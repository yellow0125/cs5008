Final Project Mock Interview Steps

1a/b. "let's get started" / confirm we can start / can you see my screen / right page etc.
 
1a/b. confirm topic or tech is working

2. read the problem to yourself

3. restate the problem you're solving

4. state the inputs/outputs/goals of the function/problem solution
	data types - paramters and returns, data types

5. talking: check the constraints
	talking: I'm going to take a minute to think through the corner cases
	thinking: determine limitations of inputs and outputs
		data types
		overflow
		base case? empty? 0 and 1s? 
	talk!
		data types
		overflow
		base case? empty? 0 and 1s? 
	think data types
	talk data types
	think overflow
	talk	 overfow
	think base case
	talk base case 
5. give an overall idea about the solution
5a. state the brute force solution
5b. analyze the brute force solution time complexity
5c. state some ideas that you have for how to beat the brute force solution
	even if you don't know how to implement them

Strategies for creating solutions: 
1. code up brute force and then try to improve upon it
2. talk through some of your ideas and pick one to implement
3. try a strategy and start coding it up

6a. actually coding and explaining
6b. explain the step, code the step
6c. the next step
6d. the next step
